              Work in a Tech Company as a Junior Developer
            </h3>
            <p data-testid="goal-one-desc">
              With about 2 years of experience, I know a lot about web
              development and built projects surrounding it. So in the next two
              years more, I hope to be a junior developer so I am currently
              putting in the work.

              Currently, I have an acceptable knowlegde on Python and
              JavaScript, even with that, I want to learn other languages in the
              next two years like C++, Java and maybe I will want to add more
              languages in the coming future.

              I have taught a few about web development, both the theory and
              practical and they learned so much. I would want to teach more
              people officially in the coming years.

              I always like seeing stories of how techies started and where they
              are and it inspires me a lot. I want to create a blog where I
              share my journey in tech so far so people will get inspired.
